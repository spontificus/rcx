[CONTROLLS]
First, you must chose an active car, to switch between the available cars, use:
 F1 - car with 1m wheel diameter
 F2 - car with 2m wheel diameter
 F3 - car with 3m wheel diameter
 F4 - car with 4m wheel diameter

Arrow keys for accelerating/reversing and steering, space for drifting breaks
Ctrl and Alt keys controlls non-locking breaks (should be easier than the
drifting breaks which will act similar to the breaks in the original games)

You can also spawn extra "debug" boxes, which will be dropped above the mark on
the ground, using F5 anf F6 (F6 dropps it at a distance which should take it
exactly 10 seconds to reach the ground - good for realitim/simtime comparision)

[REQUIREMENTS]
Shouldn't take to much computer power, any modern system will be enough.

Running the game requires the following extra runtime libraries (unless if you
are running a static binary)

Library dependenies:
	Open Dynamics Engine		(ODE)
	Simple Directmedia Layer	(SDL)
	OpenGL implementation		(os or graphics server specific)

You should compile the game yourself if you can, you will need the dev
libraries (if your distro/os package them sepparately)

[INSTALLING]
Just run the program, there is no need to move it

[COMPILING]
Running "make" in the directory containing the sourcecode should be enough,
if you are running windows, you should install MinGW (a minimalistic GNU port
running under windows) and the libraries, you are probably going to want to
compile a static binary by typing "make win32-static". If you are not running
a dev friendly os (GNU, BSD), or windows, you might have to look into changing
the normal compilation arguments in the Makefile to make compilation work.
