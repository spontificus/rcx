Welcome to a new version of rcx, featuring many different improvements (compared
to the earlier version).

[RUNNING]
In order to run a compiled binary of this version of rcx, make sure "rcx" (or
"rcx.exe" for windows) binary is located inside the directory containing the
"data" directory. If you extracted one of the official archives (0.05.tgz or
0.05.win.zip) that should not be a problem (if you compiled it from the source
available inside "src" in the archive "0.05.tgz", the binary is still placed
inside the correct directory). Simply speaking: Always keep the program
together with its “data” directory.

The src directory is only needed if you want/need to compile the program. It
can be removed if you do not need it.


[CONTROLS]
It is now possible to change keys by modifying the key list in the default
profile (data/profiles/default/keys.lst). The following is the default keys:

Arrow keys for accelerating/reversing and steering, space for drifting breaks,
Left Alt controls non-locking breaks (should be easier than the drifting breaks
which will act similar to the breaks in the original games). It is also possible
to move the camera along the X, Y and Z axes by pressing A/D , W/S and Q/E
respectively.

You can also spawn extra "debug" boxes, which will be dropped above the center
of the ground, using F5 and F6 - these keys can not be changed in the key list.
(F6 drops a box at a distance which should take it exactly 10 seconds to reach
the ground - this is good for reality/simulation time comparison)


[CONFIGURATION]
Most things in the game can now be configured using normal text files, but what
you might be most interested in is most likely specified in “data/internal.conf”.
It provides many ways of tweaking the performance, and also is the place where
you will be able to select resolution, fullscreen toggling, and eye_distance.

If you are wondering about the last one, the viewing angle in the game is
calculated based on your eye distance from the screen, in pixels: You can
determine how many pixels a normal length unit is by dividing your screen height
(or width) resolution with your physical screen height (or width). And you can
then multiply the resulting value with the distance you have measured between
your eyes and screen.

This system got the advantage of always providing a realistic viewing angle for
all resolutions. But if you don't like this, you can force a viewing angle in the
configuration file (internal.conf).


[REQUIREMENTS]
The current version shouldn't take to much computer power, any modern
system should be enough.

Running the game requires the following extra runtime libraries (unless you
are running a static binary, such as the official windows binary)

Library dependencies:
	Open Dynamics Engine		(ODE)
	Simple Directmedia Layer	(SDL)
	OpenGL implementation		(OS or graphics server specific)

If you need (or want) to compile rcx, you will need the dev version of
the libraries (but only if your distro/os provide them separately)


[INSTALLING]
Just run the program, there is no reason to install it (just make sure it's
in the same directory as "data").


[COMPILING]
Running "make" in the directory containing the sourcecode should be enough.
If you are running windows, you should install MinGW (a minimalistic GNU port
running under windows) and the libraries (requiring compilation). You are
probably going to want to compile a static binary by typing "make win32-static".
If you are not running a dev friendly os (such as GNU or BSD), or windows (which
got a separate make option), you might have to look into changing the normal
compilation arguments in the Makefile to get compilation to work.
